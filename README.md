## How to run it
The algorithms can be run in 1 of two ways
1. Navigate to the `run.py` file and press F5 (run the program)
2. From the root folder `AlgoAssignments` run `python red-scare/src/run.py` 

The program will write occasional updates to the terminal, and will continually write to a file in the `red-scare/out` folder
